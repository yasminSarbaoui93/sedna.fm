His story is not just a musical evolution; it is a timeline marked by resistance, lyrical obsession, and a relentless search for identity.\n\nFrom the gated streets of Trujillo Alto to the global stage, we explore how a restless mind transformed into the voice of a generation. The selection moves through the textures of his life: hearing the raw energy of his early rebellion, the sharp precision of his political critique, and finally, the fragile silence of his most personal confessions.\n\nIt is a study in duality. We witness the rapper who dismantles giants and the son who misses his mother. It is a soundscape that proves that sometimes, the loudest revolution happens inside.\n\nMood: Raw, Revolutionary, Introspective, Honest\nMusic genre: Latin Alternative, Hip Hop, Urban, World",
