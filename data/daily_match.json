The episode traces a personal journey that began three years ago, when a sudden injury on New Year’s Day turned a desire for movement into a mandatory season of stillness.\n\nThrough the story of a broken knee and the slow process of relearning to walk, the narrative explores the difference between being strong and being aware. It touches on the vulnerability of the body, the unexpected joy found in daily progress, and the warmth that comes from finally allowing oneself to accept help. The musical selection mirrors this path of recovery, moving from the uncertainty of change to the steady rhythm of healing.\n\nMood: Reflective, Resilient, Grounded\nMusic genre: Indie Pop, Cinematic, World, Soul\n\nWe invite you to listen deeply and find comfort in your own pace.",
